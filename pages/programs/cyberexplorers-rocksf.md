<h1 class="title">VVMS & RockSF Middle School Program </h1>

Cyber Explorers is a 15-week immersive program aimed at introducing Cyber Security discipline to high school and middle school students at [VVMS](https://www.sfusd.edu/school/visitacion-valley-middle-school) and [ROCKSF](https://rocksf.org/our-impact/). We call this cohort the *STAR CODERS*. The program doesnâ€™t assume any exposure to computers and computer science. The first 3 sessions are tabletop fun games and exercises introducing concepts of Cyber Security like Cryptography, Network Security, Defense in Depth, Incident Detection, Incident Response et al.

The students will start early in the program on a team project which could be a cybersecurity-related puzzle, poster or a project. This is a deliverable which students are expected to showcase in the Cyber Explorers finale - a open source intelligence project and a python YOUR VOICE IS POWER submission.

Through the Cyber Explorers, we aim at having a strong industry partnership using guest lectures, hackathons and exposing students to career paths. One of the session labs will be tailored as a Cyber Patriots test - which will introduce students to the Cyber Patriots program and other relevant national initiatives. 

The program finale will showcases student work and projects to a broad audience. During the duration of the program, we will offer an extensive cybersecurity library and a raspberry pi based project lab environment. We strive to align this program to other industry efforts and also offer a  hackathon.
