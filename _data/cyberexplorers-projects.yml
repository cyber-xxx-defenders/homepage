  description: The board game mimics the mind of a hacker (how they hack) and lets people be more observant to prevent from being hacked in the future. The board game is a circle with different colored spaces. Each color has a different scenario and hacking techniques that players need to learn and use to solve a problem(e.g. blue = cryptography, red = steganography etc.). By doing this we hope people learn about hackers and hacking techniques and will be vary about hackers the next time they are online.

  description: The project is Clue-hacker edition, and it informs about cyber security and hacking. In the game of Clue, there is one murderer, one weapon, and the room where it happened. Our version of Clue will include a hacker, method of attack, and the IP address of the hacker. The game raises awareness for cyber attacks; potentially, it has a positive effect on players. The goal is to make people aware of where they are putting their personal information. Our project will provide clues to a player to help solving the mystery of who, how, and where they got hacked.

  description: Our project is a type of encryption. It uses the ceaser cipher as its base. The problem that we are trying to solve is to send messages without getting any transmissions or interruptions from an anonymous User. The caesar cipher uses a number and shifts a letter by that number. That is how it gets encrypted. Instead of numbers, we are using words. Each letter in the word correlates to a number. Those number will be the shift for the word or phrase. This is a simple encryption that most people can understand if they get a walkthrough of it. It is a way to give people an introduction to encrypting words and phrases.

    - Caleb Fenton (Research Lead, SentinelOne)--Cool idea, good for learning. Roll not thine own crypto. This is kinda like using a XOR encryption. Would've been neat to see some attacks on the encryption or entropy / hardness measurements.. It's a rotating, multi-stage cesar cipher, neat.
    - Brian Koref (Senior Director Information Security, Sage Intacct, Inc.)--Great way to address crypto for a game. Creative
    - Sudarshan Srinivas (VP Marketing, Obsidian)--You took a good technical topic -- crypto -- and did solid research on it. This rabbit hole goes deep. Research how hackers try to brute force their way past Caesar cipher.. The example helped explain how the cipher works.

  description: Our project is a cyber security software that senses any trojan horses that might be downloaded onto your computer. This software allows to prevent any trojans to get onto your computer. Trojans can do a lot of damage, so this software can really help you prevent losing important information. Whenever you download a file, our software scans the file for trojan horses. If the software finds a trojan horse then it will immediately stop the download.

  points: 
    - Brian Koref (Senior Director Information Security, Sage Intacct, Inc.)--Good research skills. Educational
    - Caleb Fenton (Research Lead, SentinelOne)--It's hard for me to gauge how much effort was put into this, but the site looks really good, presentation was really good, and I'm genuinely curious to know how you plan to make everything work.. I hadn't heard about the Chinese attack, but I can read more on the site, which is public.
    - Sudarshan Srinivas (VP Marketing, Obsidian)--Good work researching anti-virus and endpoint protection. I'd love to see an implementation of the project.. You did a good job picking a specific topic that is very relevant today and diving into it.

  points: 
    - Brian Koref (Senior Director Information Security, Sage Intacct, Inc.)--Good job, very creative. Challenging
    - Caleb Fenton (Research Lead, SentinelOne)--CTFs are hardcore. Making questions is pretty hard. This looks highly technical. You know it's a good demo when you're working on it furiously the whole time, including while you're supposed to be demo'ing. potatosalad is a pretty good hostname
    - Sudarshan Srinivas (VP Marketing, Obsidian)--Ambitious project, well researched, and showed depth of research. Well done!. CTFs are a great hands-on way to learn about cybersecurity.

  points: 
    - Brian Koref (Senior Director Information Security, Sage Intacct, Inc.)--Good job. I definitely learned some new terms related to this topic.. Informative
    - Sudarshan Srinivas (VP Marketing, Obsidian)--Love the enthusiasm and the quality of research that went into the cyberbullying presentation. You can take it to the next level by getting into specific "what-if" scenarios, maybe even role playing.. Great effort behind the project! Keep up the good work.
    - Caleb Fenton (Research Lead, SentinelOne)--This is a new problem and it's a genuine problem. Kids are vulnerable and it's easy for bullies to hide behind keyboards.. I learned the word "fraping", so that's cool.

  presentation: Software
  points: 
    - Brian Koref (Senior Director Information Security, Sage Intacct, Inc.)--Good job educating on safe browsing. Good explanation of an existing problem
    - Caleb Fenton (Research Lead, SentinelOne)--Chrome extensions are an interesting direction to try educating users and making them more secure. I like the next steps ideas. There are similar ideas to this, and configuring HTTPS, SSL/TLS, and webservers in general is complex, and many configurations can go wrong, so there's a lot to check for.. I could see something like this being useful for the computer illiterate.
    - Sudarshan Srinivas (VP Marketing, Obsidian)--The team presented a simple, effective solution to build awareness about potential data leaks that users may not be aware of. Good to see that they thought through next steps to keep the project going. Continue with the project!. Lack of user awareness is a bigger threat to security than advanced attacks today.

    - Brian Koref (Senior Director Information Security, Sage Intacct, Inc.)--Looking forward to seeing your progress. Interesting program with great potential
    - Caleb Fenton (Research Lead, SentinelOne)--I see the epic games launcher, so is fortnite part of the VM? I don't know much about the bugs that are in the VM but it could be an interesting challenge. I could tell y'all had a good presentation but were just a bit rushed because of time constraints.. Cyber Patriots looks fun. I'd never heard of it until today.

    - Sudarshan Srinivas (VP Marketing, Obsidian)--The team did a good job talking about the networking portion of the Cyberpatriots competition.. Good work getting the freshmen interested in Cyberpatriots
    - Brian Koref (Senior Director Information Security, Sage Intacct, Inc.)--Network security is an often overlooked aspect of security.  Good job. Helpful content
    - Caleb Fenton (Research Lead, SentinelOne)--Cool presentation and the course looks really technical. Low-level networking knowledge is fairly rare now-a-days but it is absolutely invaluable for certain positions and problems.. Low level networking knowledge creates a good foundation and gives you insights on how you can do certain attacks, hack protocols, etc.
